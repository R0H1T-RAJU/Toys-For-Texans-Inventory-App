<h2>Toys For Texans – Inventory Application</h2>  
<p>
The Toys For Texans Inventory Handler is a Swift-based application that helps us organize and manage donations. It allows our volunteers to create donation boxes, add items to each box, and keep track of all inventory in one place. This makes it simple to distribute toys and supplies efficiently to families/communities in need.
