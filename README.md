<h2>Toys For Texans – Inventory Application</h2>  
<p>
The Toys For Texans Inventory Handler is a Swift-based application that is built to streamline donation management for Toys For Texans. It allows our volunteers to create donation boxes, add and update items within each of those boxes, and keep track of all inventory in one place. This makes it simple to manage and distribute toys and supplies efficiently to families/communities in need.
